[The Psychology of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681) is a book written by **Morgan Housel** that I've been wanting to read for a few months. I finally did it and here's some key takeaway that I think is important to remember.
#### Consistent compounding over 'short burst'. 
Instead of trying to earn a lot in a single day, earn 'enough' consistently. It will compound overtime. What people often overlooked when judging someone's wealthiness is 'time'. The wealth has been built up for years. Remember that Warren Buffet has been investing since he's 10 years old -- albeit something not everyone could do.
#### Luck and Risk goes hand in hand
People don't attribute 'Luck', they even see it as somewhat condescending. In reality, 'Luck' plays quite a big role in someone's success or misfortune. People who are wealthy are people who happens to be in the right time, the right moment, the right place, and doing the right thing. Not everyone have the same faith. Don't be too fixated on the things they do, always account that there is some 'Luck' at play.

> Not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness. Keep this in mind when judging people, including yourself.

#### Getting wealthy is different from staying wealthy
Getting wealthy is a thing, staying wealthy is another thing. The key of being wealthy boils down into 'Paranoia'. Being scared that in a single day your fortune could just flip over because nobody can predict the future.
#### Always plan for something for a plan that is not going according to plan
Sounds a bit complicated, but the main point here is that always make your plan robust. The less factors or variables can affect your plan, the better it is. The more flexible your plan is, the better it is. If one variable suddenly goes wrong, if your plan goes wrong then that's not a very good plan, it should still somewhat work albeit not 100% according to plan.
