There are some things that needs to be focused:

- **Progressive Overload**
	This means adding more weight as you go along. This should be consistently done, usually when starting out you'd improve way quicker compared to when you've been training for years
- **Focus on eccentric movement**s
	Basically, you need to slow down the movement when you're doing the eccentric bit. For example, if you're doing [[Bicep Curls]], you need to slow down on the way down but you can burst it on the way up (as long as you're the biceps rather than the momentum)
