There are several variations to build the biceps. Only a few of them I really like:
## Dumbbell Curls
I mean nothing to say much about this. It's the simplest yet effective form of doing it. There are two types of grip that you can use: **Supinated** and **Pronated** grip.
### Supinated
This targets the *short-head* part of the muscle, the thing that usually looks big on bodybuilders. It's when you put your arm facing up, so the palm faces up.
### Pronated
This targets the muscle that's called *brachialis* or the *long-head*. It's the muscle below the short-head. It helps to make the short-head looks bigger.
