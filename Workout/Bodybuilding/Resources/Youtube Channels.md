These are some Youtube channel I like to watch on my free time. The list will continue to grow as I discover more and more channels.

- [Jeff Nippard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68TLK0mAEzUyHx5x5k-S1Q)
	- My go-to reference whenever I'm looking for any tips, tricks, guide, etc. Basically everything workout related I go to Jeff's channel because it's science based and he always brings up the reference to the paper he used for the video.
	- The quality of the videos he made are so good to a point where you think it shouldn't be free. It's high quality stuff.
- [Renaissance Periodization](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQgsKhHjSyRLOp9mnffqVg)
	- Another channel that is *science-based* just like **Jeff Nippard**. It's hosted by **Dr. Mike Israetel** who's a Phd on this topic.
	- I like how he joke in his videos lmao it's sometimes just pure unhinged content I love it.
