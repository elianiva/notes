**Nix** is quite a bit of something. It's a *language* while also a *package manager* while also an *operating system*.

Most people use Nix for its reproducibility and declarative nature for installing packages and setting up development environment because it makes them portable.

After using Nix for a while, I gathered a bunch of useful stuff that it's probably worth to write down for myself to read in the future.
