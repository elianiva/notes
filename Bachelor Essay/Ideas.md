There are several ideas that I want to do for my bachelor essay. This will probably change when I actually do them:
- Implement Static Code Analysis to automatically grade students' assignments, more specifically programming assigments.
	Basically we're trying to make a web app and a vscode extension that lets the lecturer create a rule for the code and the extension will be able to submit the students' code. I pretty much wrote the proposal for this one in https://github.com/elianiva/uni-stuff/blob/master/bachelor-essay
