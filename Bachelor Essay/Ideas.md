There are several ideas that I want to do for my bachelor essay. This will probably change when I actually do them:
- Implement Static Code Analysis to automatically grade students' assignments, more specifically programming assigments.
	Basically we're trying to make a web app and a vscode extension that lets the lecturer create a rule for the code and the extension will be able to submit the students' code. I pretty much wrote the proposal for this one in https://github.com/elianiva/uni-stuff/blob/master/bachelor-essay
- Implement vectorised operation for a fast HTAP database compatible with SQLite file format.
	As the title says. This is not gonna be easy but it's sure as hell gonna be fun. Need to think more about it.
- Anything related
