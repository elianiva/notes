Japanese Language has 3 ways of writing. They're not mutually exclusive, but rather you combine them all to make a sentence.
## Kanji (漢字)
This is the same as the ones you see in Chinese writings because it is! It's basically Chinese letters that has been adapted. How about the pronounciation? Well, we have **Kunyomi** and **Onyomi**.
#### Kunyomi
The reading that's been created by the Japanese people. It's usually used when the kanji is being used standalone or combined with **Hiragana** or **Katakana**.
#### Onyomi
The reading adapted from the original Chinese language. It's usually used when the Kanji is combined with other Kanji.

For references, here are some example for **Kunyomi** and **Onyomi** readings:

| Kanji | Meaning   | Onyomi (音読み) | Kunyomi (訓読み) |

| 水     | Water     | すい (sui)     | みず (mizu)     |
| 山     | Mountain  | さん (san)     | やま (yama)     |
| 木     | Tree      | もく (moku)    | こ (ko)        |
