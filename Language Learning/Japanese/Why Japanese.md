I explained most of the reason why I started to learn Japanese on this post https://elianiva.my.id/posts/a-year-of-japanese/, but basically, it boils down into these things:
1. I've been wanting to learn a language which uses different writing system. There are several of them but the big three in my head was Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. I decided to learn Japanese because it was somewhat somewhere in between of Chinese and Korean.
2. Stupid reason but still a reason, is because I was listening too much Babymetal songs and I love them. I went on a spree to watch a bunch of the interviews and they're in Japanese. I want to understand what they're saying without the subtitles.
